# LP_Solver Mavenized and OSGi Ready

This is an example service which mavenizes the Java ILP (java interface to integer linear programming (ILP) solvers) [1]
and makes it OSGi ready. The challenge was to make the native library available in OSGi

The current build is platform dependent and only tested with
Ubuntu: 12.04.4 LTS 64bit
Apache Maven 3.0.5
Java version: 1.7.0_51, vendor: Oracle Corporation
